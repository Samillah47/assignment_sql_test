# Library Management System Database

This database system manages records for a library, including books, authors, members, and loans. The project demonstrates the ability to effectively manage library records using Oracle SQL.

## Purpose

This database is created as part of my school assignment, serving as a practical example of database design and management. It aims to help in understanding key concepts such as relational databases, SQL queries, and data integrity in the context of a library management system.
